This is a fork of MobileTerminal that complies with Apple's official SDK.  The
plan is that pieces of the current MobileTerminal in /trunk/ will be ported
over one piece at a time so that the entire system can build using the official
toolchain headers (in an XCode project).

Strategies to consider while porting:
- Rewrite pieces from scratch using supported APIs when existing components
  depend heavily on private headers.
- Break down components by dependencies, to break some of the spaghetti that
  has arisen over the years.  (A Subprocess package, a v100 package, etc)
- When necessary, create local copies of private header files, or use local
  declarations in .m files.

The history of the project is that it was started before any official header
files were released, and therefore uses unsupported headers.  Now it is simply
much easier to use the standard set, with a handful of minor modifications
instead.

Lets try and get a working binary ASAP, then start hacking.
