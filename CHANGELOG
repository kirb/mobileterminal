= CHANGELOG =

== r2?? ==

  * splash screen replaced
  * dependencies added to make process

== r265 ==

  * terminal arguments preferences added
  * command line arguments re-enabled: 
    * when launched from the shell, additional arguments get executed in the first terminal
    * if arguments is a directory, the first shell cd's to that directory
    * still crashes if started from shell without arguments :-(
  * hopefully resolved the problems that made the app crash in multi-terminal mode on non-Cydia systems
  * svn version number is displayed in the about page
  * missing header files added

== r257 ==

  * gesture commands and menu buttons are read from defaults file

  * bugfixes
    * should link against the original ncurses.dylib now (version 5.4)
    * fixed a problem with the gesture area after application resume
    * fixed a bug in the color chooser by replacing it with a much simpler solution :-)

  * application size reduced by removing unused images from the Resources
  
== r250 ==
